# WisdomWave Educational Platform

Welcome to the WisdomWave project repository! WisdomWave is an educational platform inspired by the renowned website [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). Our goal is to provide a seamless and enriching learning experience for users across the globe.

## Project Overview

WisdomWave leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver a feature-rich educational platform. Here's a breakdown of the key components and technologies used in our project:

### Backend (ASP.NET 8 C#)

The backend of WisdomWave is built using [ASP.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) with C#. This powerful combination enables us to create a robust and scalable server-side application to handle user authentication, course management, and data storage.

### Frontend (React/WEB5/Node18/Js)

The frontend of WisdomWave is developed using a modern tech stack, including [React](https://reactjs.org/), [WEB5](https://web.dev/), [Node18](https://nodejs.org/en/), and JavaScript. This ensures a responsive and dynamic user interface, providing an engaging learning environment for our users.

### Cloud Services (Azure)

WisdomWave relies on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) for hosting the backend and managing our SQL database. Azure's cloud services offer scalability, security, and reliability, ensuring a seamless experience for both learners and instructors.

### Frontend Hosting (Vercel)

The frontend of WisdomWave is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform that provides fast and efficient hosting for web applications. Vercel's global CDN ensures low latency and quick loading times, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Version Control and Collaboration (Git)

We utilize [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaborative development. This allows our team to efficiently manage code changes, track project history, and coordinate efforts to continuously improve WisdomWave.
